Running the Weather App Project with PHP

I've created a weather app project using PHP, and I'd like to guide you on how to run it on your computer. To do this, we'll use a tool called XAMPP, which helps set up a web server environment. Follow these steps to get started:

Step 1: Install XAMPP
1. If you don't already have XAMPP installed, you'll need to download and install it. You can get XAMPP from the official website [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). XAMPP includes everything we need for our project, like a web server (Apache), a database server (MySQL), PHP, and more.

Step 2: Start XAMPP
1. After installing XAMPP, look for the XAMPP control panel on your computer. You can usually find it in the Start menu on Windows or in the Applications folder on macOS.
2. In the XAMPP control panel, there are buttons labeled "Start" next to "Apache" (the web server) and "MySQL" (the database). Click both of these "Start" buttons to activate them. This is like turning on the power for our web server.

Step 3: Create a Project Directory
1. Now, we need a place to store our weather app project files. Inside the XAMPP folder on your computer (typically located at "C:\xampp" on Windows or "/Applications/XAMPP" on macOS), find a folder called "htdocs."
2. Create a new folder inside "htdocs" for our weather app project. You can name it anything you like; in my case, I named it "weather_app."

Step 4: Access the Weather App Project
1. You can access our Weather App Project by opening a web browser (like Chrome or Firefox).
2. In the web address bar of your browser, type `http://localhost/weather_app` (replace "weather_app" with the actual name of your project directory). Hit "Enter."
3. Congratulations! You should now see the Weather App running in your web browser. You can explore it, check the weather, and interact with the app right on your computer.

That's it! You've successfully set up a web server using XAMPP and are now running the Weather App Project locally on your computer.
